    <h1><em>Description</em></h1>
    <p>The love of chicken in a bucket up and down the UK is clear to see. So, here's a tasty, homemade version with upgraded chicken and two exciting veggie sides. Enjoy JFC!</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>800 g sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>2 headped tablespoons fine cornmeal or polenta</li>
        <li>1 x 1.8 kg whole higher-welfare chicken</li>
        <li>1 headped tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>1 small red onion</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>1 apple</li>
        <li>1/4 of a white cabbage</li>
        <li>1 headped teaspoon English mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine</li>
        <li>3 headped tablespoons fat-free natural yoghurt</li>
        <li>350 g low-sugar cornflakes</li>
        <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
        <li>4 frozen mini corn on the cobs</li>    
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. </li>
        <li>Scrub the sweet potatoes clean, slice into wedges, toss in a tray with a little olive oil, 1 heaped tablespoon of cornmeal or polenta and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then put aside. </li>
        <li>Cut up your chicken (see my tips on how to joint a chicken below – you'll need to split the legs into thighs and drumsticks for this recipe as described in step 8), then remove and discard the skin and lay the pieces on a large baking tray. </li>
        <li>Add the remaining cornmeal or polenta, a good lug of olive oil and the Cajun seasoning to the tray, squash over the garlic through a garlic crusher, then toss and massage to coat the chicken. Place on the top shelf of the oven, pop the wedges underneath and cook for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel the onion and coarsely grate in a food processor with the carrots, apple and cabbage. Tip into a bowl and mix with the mustard, extra virgin olive oil, vinegar and yoghurt, then season to perfection and put aside. </li>
        <li>Crush the cornflakes into fine crumbs and whisk the eggs.</li>
        <li>When the time’s up, remove the chicken from the oven, then carefully brush the pieces with the beaten egg and use tongs to firmly press them in the cornflake crumbs until they’re all evenly coated. </li>
        <li>Return the tray to the bottom of the oven, quickly turn the wedges and cook for a further 40 minutes, or until the chicken and sweet potatoes are golden and cooked through. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grill the frozen corn on a hot griddle pan for around 15 minutes, or until hot through and charred, turning occasionally. </li>
        <li>Take everything to the table, get excited and dig in.</li>
    </ol>
