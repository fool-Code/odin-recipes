                <li>1 fresh red chilli</li>
                <li>1 bunch of fresh basil, (30g)</li>
                <li>300 g dried spaghetti</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>1 x 400 g tin of quality plum tomatoes</li>

            </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic and chilli (halve and deseed it first if you donâ€™t want the sauce too hot). </li>
                <li>Pick the basil leaves off the stalks and put to one side. Finely chop the stalks.</li>
                <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 2 good lugs of oil. Add the garlic, chilli and basil stalks and give them a stir.</li>
                <li>When the garlic begins to brown slightly, add most of the basil leaves and scrunch in the tomatoes. Turn the heat up high and stir for 1 minute. Taste and season with sea salt and black pepper, if needed./li>
                <li>Drain the spaghetti, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then transfer it to the pan of sauce and stir well. Add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen, if needed, then taste and season to perfection.</li>
                <li>Divide the pasta between bowls, or put it on the table in a large serving dish and let everyone help themselves. </li>
                <li>Roughly tear over the remaining basil leaves and finely grate over the Parmesan.</li>
            </ol>
